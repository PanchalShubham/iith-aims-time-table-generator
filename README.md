# iith-aims-time-table-generator  
This is a vanilla JS script which will help you in generating your time table from `registration page in AIMS`.  
This script generates time table and opens it in new window which can be downloaded as pdf using `Ctrl + P`.

## How to use  
1. Login on AIMS and open the courses registration page (prefer Google Chrome).  
2. Open the web console (use the table below for keyboard shortcuts).  
3. Paste the contents of `time-table-generator.js` on the console and hit `Enter`  
4. You should be able to see your time table for registered courses in a new window. This might take a while.  
5. Also `aims-time-table.csv` will be generated which you can directly import to google-sheets for management.  

#### Keyboard shortcuts to open the web console  
| | Google Chrome | Mozilla Firefox |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows or Linux | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `J` | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K` |
| Mac | `Cmd` + `Opt` + `J` | `Cmd` + `Opt` + `K` |
